Statistics and Probability (MSP) 
Project 1 / 2024

Overview

In this project, we use Python and statistical methods to analyze the runtime performance of six different algorithm configurations. Each configuration was executed 200 times, and the goal is to explore the data, visualize key patterns, and draw meaningful statistical conclusions from the results. The project emphasizes understanding and applying core statistical procedures in a practical context.
